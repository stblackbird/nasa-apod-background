desktop_nasa.py

DESCRIPTION
Gets the latest image of the day from NASA, http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/,
gets the description for that image, resize image to keep original proportions, write description to it
and set it as the background in Gnome.

INSTALLATION
This script will work as it is if your are on Ubuntu.
You only need to get (if you already don't have), python PIL library using this command:

sudo apt-get install python-imaging

next add script to startup scripts:
System -> Preferences -> Startup Applications

and add script like this:
python /dir/to/script/desktop_nasa.py

I successfully use this script for a few years now, so it should work every day.
